Basic Gesture Detection
===========

This program uses Python 2 and OpenCV 2 to attempt to detect the user's hand gestures. Gestures can be mapped to different actions and new gestures can be trained.

Currently works best in low lighting.

Yet to be implemented:

~ Gesture determination
~ Gesture training
~ Better hand/center detection
~ Finger detection
